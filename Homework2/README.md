## Project Overview

The goal of the assignment is to implement a custom symbol table structure using Red-Black Trees (RBT). The provided files cover the basic infrastructure. The symbol table utilizes a RBT and is implimented in `ST.hpp` and applied in `main.cpp`.

## Files Provided

The following files were provided for this assignment:
- `RBT.hpp`: Contains the Red-Black Tree class implementation.
- `RBTNode.hpp`: Defines the Red-Black Tree Node structure.
- `RBTPrint.hpp`: Provides functions to visualize and print the tree.

The following files were written by me:
- `ST.hpp`: This is the header file for the symbol table structure, utilizing Red-Black Trees for storage and retrieval operations.
- `STmain.cpp`: The main program that demonstrates the functionality of the symbol table.

## Compilation

To compile the code, use a C++ compiler (such as g++) with the following command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
```
main.cpp imports the symbol table, so compilation isnt necessary.

## Execution

To execute the program, simply run the compiled executable:
```bash
./main
```
**OR**
```bash
./a.out
```
